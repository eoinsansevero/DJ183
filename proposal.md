### Why DJ 183?
There are many reasons why our group chose this project, but the main two are the nostalgia of recreating a game from our childhoods and the desire to learn how to build a website. After having completed the back-end and learning about concepts such as post, get, forms, etc, we feel very confident in our abilities to create websites independently.

### Previous Web Experience
Nobody in our group has any!

### Overall Project Description
This website provides an interactive song quiz. Users are prompted 5 music genres to choose from, then are played a song and given multiple choice answers containing the possible artists and song name for the anonymous song that was played. After guessing the user is prompted to an answer page that shows their current score and whether or not they answered the question correctly. From here they can change genres, or be asked another question. Our website will be unique through making it very stylish with css and adding pictures, videos, and artist information. Additionally, we plan to make it mobile-friendly and contain  a data base.


### Group Logistics
While we planned on dividing and conquering our group met every singles day Monday-Friday in the ugli. We worked day and night as a group.
